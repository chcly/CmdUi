# CmdUi

CmdUi is a basic cross platform console UI. The aim of this project is to
extract the UI code from the HackComputer project, test it and `possibly` develop it further.

## Testing

The testing directory is setup to work with [googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest).
It contains the initial setup for testing this library as a standalone module using GitHub actions.

## Building

It builds with cmake, and it has been tested on Windows and Unix platforms using
the Visual Studio an Unix MakeFile cmake generators.

### Building with CMake and Make

```sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DCmdUi_BUILD_TEST=ON -DCmdUi_AUTO_RUN_TEST=ON
make
```
